Here we try to define a realistic and complete that considers the placement problem besides the management resources.
In our problem we consider many requirements including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Some of the physical servers may not be managed by specific set of physical server because of their distance or security concerns.
    \item VNFs have typs and may be there are restrictions on their placement.
    \item Each VNFM needs a license for managing the specific number of VNF instances.
\end{itemize}

\par
Consider n chains known a priori with their specifications and requirements.
VNFs have types and each type has its specific memory and processing requirement.
We don't share VNFs between chains and each chain has a single VNFM for consistent management and monitoring.
We want to place chains with their VNFM to maximize profit. Accepting each chain has specific gain and buying license costs.
