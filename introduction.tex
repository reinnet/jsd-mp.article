In NFV ecosystem, each chain must be monitored and managed by a VNFM. Similar to other virtual functions, VNFMs need computing and network resources and  can manage a limited number of chains.
Our work considers Service Chain Placement Problem and Manager Placement Problem jointly and wants to place chains and their corresponding VNFM at the same time.
We believe this work hasn't been done in the literature before.
By considering the joint problem, you may not accept a chain that you don't have any management resource for it,
or you can get many chains that have little management resource requirement.
These considerations create a better solution with more profit to datacenter from provisioning the set of chains,
and the results in \ref{sec:joint-vs-disjoint} approves it.
