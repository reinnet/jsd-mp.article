\begin{abstract}
In the old times, Network providers use hardware network functions to create their service chains, but a change in this manner is difficult and may cause many service distribution.
SFC and NFV is the solution to this difficulty. By using SFC and NFV, providers can provision chains dynamically and then change them in runtime.
One of the main requirements is management and monitoring for the chains.
In this research, we consider the chain acceptance problem subject to management resources. In the first step, we formulate
problem with ILP and then implement it in CPLEX framework. As we know, ILP problems are NP-Hard, so we need a Polynomial-Time solution to the problem.
In this research, we create a heuristic algorithm and compare its result with the optimal solution. In the end, the heuristic solution produces near-optimal results in the polynomial time.
